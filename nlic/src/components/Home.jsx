            <p>Our hope is to see the expansion of God's kingdom as each and every member is equipped to serve God wherever they goâ€”whether that is in the home, the workplace, the business world, the arts, politics, or law. We pray that this would impact families, communities, neighborhoods, our commonwealth, nation, and the world.</p>
            <p>Though there is much darkness in the world, we aim to shed the light of the gospel wherever we go, living under the love of God, knowing His law and gospel, and thriving as we follow Him.</p>
            <p>As we go out, believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and living out our calling for God's glory, we trust that we will see God build His kingdom.</p>
            <p>We believe the starting point is faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>We believe the call of the church is to equip each and every member for their work of service in the world. And as that happens, God builds His kingdom, spreading light, love, and joy in the fullness of His Son.</p>
            <p>We invite you to join us in this endeavor.</p>
